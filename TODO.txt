* Locks are not reentrant, count is never incremented (according to rest result)
* proper REST interface

* PUT /a/b/c?session-id # locks /a/b/c for the given session
* PUT /?session-id&scope=deep # deep locks the whole tree
* GET /a/b/c returns the lock info for /a/b/c or File not found
* GET /a/b/c?scope=deep returns all locks below /a/b/c as a tree rooted at /a/b/c (including the prefix in each path
* GET /a/b/c?session-id&scope=deep # returns all locks below /a/b/c owned by the given session
* DEL /a/b?scope=deep?session-id # releases all locks held by session-id below /a/b

lock type (upgrade)
lock scope (upgrade)

LockInfo
  path
  scope
  type
  count
  session

Better would be nested lock info
 


* mvn jetty:run listens on 8080 although 8090 is configured 
* (client) library with AutoCloseable locks hiding the service
* client to wrap the RESTful service (implements LockManager)
* test REST client with core lock manager and AutoCloseable lock manager tests
* write more concurrent tests (first debug concurrent test framework)
* use proper intention locks to enable correct assertions
* self test with more assertions

* distribute with Paxos
* test distributed Zuul with AutoCloseable lock manager tests
* let nodes communicate in a binary format with each other (binary client and server interfaces)
* compress communication between nodes by computing huffman codes for common prefixes
