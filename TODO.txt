* write more tests (first debug concurrent test framework)
* create a unified interface, must match
** REST service
** embedded?
** input to client library (client library shall be able to wrap REST service and embedded)
* (client) library with AutoCloseable locks hiding the service
* client to wrap the RESTful service (implements LockManager)
* use proper intention locks to enable correct assertions
* self test with more assertions

* distribute with Paxos
* let nodes communicate in a binary format
* compress communication between nodes by computing huffman codes for common prefixes
