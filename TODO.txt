* (client) library with AutoCloseable locks hiding the service
* client to wrap the RESTful service (implements LockManager)
* test REST client with core lock manager and AutoCloseable lock manager tests
* write more concurrent tests (first debug concurrent test framework)
* use proper intention locks to enable correct assertions
* self test with more assertions

* distribute with Paxos
* test distributed Zuul with AutoCloseable lock manager tests
* let nodes communicate in a binary format with each other (binary client and server interfaces)
* compress communication between nodes by computing huffman codes for common prefixes
